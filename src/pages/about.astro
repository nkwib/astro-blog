        Hi, I'm Gabriele Magno and I am a self taught developer working in the industry for more than 5 years now. My expertise is within the Javascript echosystem but I can work with Go, Python and Rust as well.

        After a bunch of wrong career choices (I've been a climbing coach, a waiter, a bartender, a bar-owner and a nurse), I rediscovered my passion for programming and decided to share some knowledge with this blog.
